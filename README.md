# AdventOfCode2020
This repository contains solutions to the 2020 edition of Advent of Code.

The source code is written in Python 3.8. In addition to the standard library, only one external PyPI package is used: `regex`. And it's used only in the solution to part 2 of the day 19 puzzle.

Tests are written using the standard `unittest` library and can be run from the project base folder in regular fashion (`python3.8 -m unittest`).

Solution code and test code is structured so as to enable verifying every piece of data provided in the puzzle description. Pieces of code might be optimized for speed, but execution times are still reasonably low on my 6-year-old hardware.
